* Integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines.
* Collaborating with developers and stakeholders to identify and resolve software defects.
* Contributing to the improvement of software quality processes.


## My Projects - I have listed a couple of personal projects to showcase my foundational skills in software testing. 

* TryCloud_UITestAutomationDemo: a simple UI test automation demo for TryCloud, built with Java, Maven, Selenium, and Cucumber for BDD-style tests. It uses JUnit, follows the Page Object Model and Singleton design patterns, supports parallel testing, and generates HTML reports. Tests cover login, navigation, personal info management, and file management.
  
* RestfulBooker_ApiAutomationDemo: a comprehensive test automation framework for the Restful Booker API. It is designed to facilitate thorough testing of the API through data-driven tests, schema validation, and organized test suites. The framework is built using Java, JUnit 5, REST Assured, and Log4j2 for robust logging.
